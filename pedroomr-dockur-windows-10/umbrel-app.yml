  It’s Windows 10... but cooler — running in Docker, on your Umbrel, like a boss.


  ⚠️ Minimum Requirements

  CPU: x86_64 processor (Intel or AMD)

  RAM: At least 4 GB

  Disk: Starts small but dynamically expands up to 64 GB


  The main interface is available on port 8010 (through the browser),
  and also supports RDP connections on port 3391.


  ✅ File sharing with your Umbrel
  
 
  Open File Explorer inside Windows and go to '\\host.lan\Data'
  
  This maps to your Umbrel's downloads folder. Use this to exchange files between your Umbrel and the virtual machine.


  ⚠️ Your device must support virtualization and enabled in the BIOS/UEFI!
